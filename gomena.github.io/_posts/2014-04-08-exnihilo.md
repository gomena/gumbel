Ex Nihilo is a latin expression which literally means 'out of nothing'. According to some people, God is a concept invented my Man, and man is in turn a random product of the evolution of Universe. I wanted to represent that vision in this GIF, taking the classic painting 'Creazione di Adamo' by Michelangelo (c. 1512). To make it, at each iteration I randomly perturbed every pixel of the figure (by changing it to it's neighbor position), and then created the motion doing the iterations from the end to the begining.
