It all started when my father taught me some notions of Visual Basic, and with the priceless help of the code completion tool (yeah, no Google at that time). Since then, I've been enjoying coding and here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Notes
Some notes I have written over the years. They don't have enough stuff to qualify as a paper, but happy if someone can find some utility in them.
* [**On the summability of the weights for completely random measures**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/SumPoissonProcess.pdf)<br>
The result of a discussion during an insightful class by Professor [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/)

* [**On the relation between matching by propensity score and weighted least squares estimator for the average treatment effect**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/Comment_WLS_ATE.pdf)<br>
Result of a discussion in the Machine Learning Reading group led by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/)

* [**Qualyfing exam cheatsheet**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/cheatsheet.pdf)


### Gifs
I like the idea of turning mathematical/computational concepts into gifs. Sometimes they can be really cool. Here some examples
* [**Mandelbrot sets**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/fractals1/)
* [**Artificial snowflakes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/snowflakes/)<br>
* [**Phosphene and mandala**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/phosphene/)<br>
* [**Gaussian Densities**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/tiling/)<br>
* [**The creation of Adam and God Ex Nihilo**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/exnihilo/)<br>
* [**Gaussian Processes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/gp/)<br>
* [**Cosmic Rays**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/cosmic/)<br>
* [**Neural Spikes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/spikes/)<br>
